## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (Complete These Steps First)

### 1. Set Up Project Board
1. **Go to Projects tab** â†’ **New project**
2. **Select "CHI Research Template"** from organization templates (if available)
   - OR manually create **Board layout** with columns: Backlog â†’ In Progress â†’ In Review â†’ Done
3. **Name**: `[Your Project Name] Research Progress`
4. **Link this repository** to the project

### 2. Update This README
- [ ] Replace `[Project Title]` with your actual project name
- [ ] Fill in your research focus and goals
- [ ] Select your CHI meta-project connections
- [ ] Choose your current SRDMPA phase

### 3. Create First Issues
- [ ] **Milestone Issue**: Define your first major deliverable using the Milestone template
- [ ] **Research Log Issue**: Start weekly progress tracking using Research Log template
- [ ] **Label appropriately**: Use `01-speculate` through `06-assess` plus `activity-*` labels

### 4. Follow Detailed Setup
See [`docs/researcher-setup.md`](docs/researcher-setup.md) for complete configuration guide.

- [ ] **docs/research-notes/**: Add your initial research questions
- [ ] **references/meta-projects.md**: Link to relevant CHI meta-projects

## Research Progress

### Current Milestones
[Use GitHub Issues with Milestone template to track major deliverables]

### Recent Activity
[Use Research Log issues to document weekly progress]

### AI Collaboration
[Use AI Collaboration Report issues to track and evaluate AI tool usage]

## Data and Analysis

### Data Sources
[Describe your data sources, collection methods, or experimental setup]

### Key Findings
[Update as your research progresses - link to notebooks, papers, or presentations]

### Reproducibility

## Repository Structure

- **`data/`** - Research datasets (raw and processed)
- **`src/`** - Source code and analysis functions
- **`notebooks/`** - Jupyter notebooks organized by research phase
- **`docs/`** - Documentation and research notes
- **`references/`** - Literature, citations, and external resources
- **`assets/`** - Figures, presentations, and media files

For detailed explanations, see `docs/repository-structure.md`.

## Minimal skeleton & recommended cleanup

When you instantiate this template, you may see many files and directories. Not all are strictly required for every project. The steps below will help you simplify your repository while keeping essential functionality.

Essential (keep these unless you have a specific reason to remove):
- `README.md` - Project overview and quick setup (update from this template)
- `CITATION.cff` - Citation metadata for academic projects
- `LICENSE` - License for the repository
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines for your collaborators
- `.gitignore` & `.gitattributes` - Git configuration
- `docs/` - Setup and repository structure docs (keep at least `docs/researcher-setup.md`)
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Issue templates used by the project

Optional (safe to delete or move to `docs/` if not needed):
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts; move essentials into `docs/` or keep only the ones you use
- `data/` - Data folders or placeholders (if you don't store data in the repo, you can remove these directories)
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks (keep only those you actively use)
- `tests/` - Testing scaffolding (remove if not using automated tests)
- `references/` - Reference lists and meta-project links (move to `docs/` if preferred)

Cleanup checklist (run after instantiation):
1. Update `README.md` from this template: replace placeholders and remove sections that don't apply.
2. Remove `README.template.md` (the setup workflow does this automatically if present).
3. Remove or prune `data/`, `notebooks/`, `tests/` directories if they are only placeholders.
4. Review `.github/workflows/` and keep only the automation you will rely on. Remove the setup workflow once it has run.
5. Update `CITATION.cff` and `LICENSE` for your project.
6. Add a brief `SETUP.md` (optional) documenting how this repository was initialized and what the template changed.

If you want a completely minimal repo, keep only `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CITATION.cff`, and `.gitignore` â€” everything else can be added later as needed.
